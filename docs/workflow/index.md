# Project Setup and Workflow Management

When starting a new project, most of us spend time thinking about *what* to create, but not about
how to *manage* its creation. In other words, we start creating files (code files, data files, Word documents),
and put those somewhere in our file system. The better ones start sorting files in directories, or
keep track of version numbers for files (e.g., 20191126_mycode.R) to remember which file was created
when. But - let us promise you - even that much of a good intention will very likely resort in chaos down the road.

For example, have a look at the directory and file structure of a PhD project Hannes once
was working on (back in 2013). A mapping of the files and directories, without the actual
content of the files, is [available here](structure_phd_2013.html).

Try to find...

- the code that prepared the dataset, and
- the code of the econometric model that eventually got published.

As you will quickly realize, the folder structure is a mess, and the original model is almost impossible to find.

Well - avoiding this chaos is **at the core of implementing a workflow management system**, and your primary mission.

The following pages should help you to get introduced to a few principles of a proper workflow management system.

!!! tip "Tips"
    * We may sometimes sound a bit dogmatic about certain things (e.g., you MUST do this or that). Please trust us that many of our teachings will make sense only after a while; so - stick with our recommendations during the course of your first few projects. Later on, take the liberty to design the workflows to your needs.
    * Consider adopting our suggestions **gradually**
        1. Start with a proper [module/directory structure](directories.md)
        2. Start [automating](automation.md) your workflows
        3. Add [documentation](doc.md) to your modules/directories and your (raw) data
        4. Start to version your code to keep track of changes + clean up
	  * You should be able to complete this subchapter in one sitting within 60-120 minutes.
