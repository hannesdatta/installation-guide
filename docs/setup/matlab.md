# Installing Matlab

MATLAB is a high-level programming language and an environment for numerical computation and visualization.

The University of Zurich has a campus-wide MATLAB license available to all students and employees.
We will use this license to activate MATLAB on our machine.

If you do not have Matlab 2016a installed on your machine, please follow the [installation instructions](https://www.s3it.uzh.ch/software/matlab/) available on the University of Zurich's page.
